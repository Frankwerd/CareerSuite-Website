# Francis J. LiButti's Dynamic AI Portfolio ü§ñ‚ú®

**Why just read a resume when you can *converse* with my experience?** Traditional portfolios are static.
That's why I've leveraged an innovative template to build my dynamic AI portfolio.

This isn't just a website; it's a direct channel to my strategic thinking, data analysis skills, and passion for AI innovation.
Instead of endless scrolling, my AI persona adapts to *your* curiosity. Just ask a question ‚Äî and get instant, tailored insights into my projects and expertise.

## üëá What can you ask?

- üß† **Tech Recruiter?** Ask about my data-driven impact & AI project results (like CareerSuite.AI!).
- üíª **Potential Client/Collaborator?** Dive into how I streamline operations & secure high-value outcomes.
- üí° **Fellow Innovator?** Explore my journey in full-spectrum problem-solving, from AgTech validation (NSF I-Corps) to robotic leadership (HAV Project).
